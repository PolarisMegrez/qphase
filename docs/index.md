# Welcome to QPhase

**QPhase** is a high-performance, modular Python framework for simulating quantum optical systems using Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) in the phase space.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Monorepo structure separating Core, Physics Engine, and Visualization.
- **Plugin System**: Easily extendable Backends, Integrators, and Models.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Fully reproducible simulations defined via declarative YAML files.

## Getting Started
